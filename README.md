## Assignments
All programming assignments in this course are targeted to the Android mobile phone development platform:
- Assignment1: Development Environment & Touch Buttons
- Assignment2: Containers, Fragments, Select, Lists and Files
- Assignment3: Mobile App Backends, Images, and Location
- Assignment4: Threads, Local Databases and Face Detection

The requirments and explanation for all assignments are available inside the folders for each assignment in pdf format.

## Issues
I tried to complete all assignments and all assignments passes basic requirements. However there are potentials to improve the above submitted assignments.
 

## Final project
Our final project is a mobile application named UofT&Me. “U of T & Me” app incorporates a comprehensive list of recommendations that would allow for personalized information to be made immediately available to students-in-need. The recommendations are customized depending on the data that is automatically gathered, and a student's responses to an initial questionnaire. Early in the development process our team chose to develop the application focusing on the sleep component of the health, in order to facilitate a deeper investigation into the possibilities. The final version of “U of T & Me” app; however, will provide a user with six different self-care categories: Nutrition, Physical Activity, Sleep, Academics, Social Network, and Mood.
